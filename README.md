# **Space_Shooter_Game**


### *How it Works*
- An alien appearing at the top of the screen moves toward the bottom of the screen
- The objective is for the spaceship, which is at the bottom of the screen, to fire a bullet to kill the alien

### *Gameplay and Scoring*
- If the bullet hits the alien, the score increases by one.
- Each time the alien is hit, it disappears, and a new alien falls to the bottom of the screen faster.
- If the alien hits the bottom of the screen, the game is over.

### *Bullet System*
- The spaceship may only fire one bullet
- The spaceship can only fire a bullet once the bullet has either gone to the top of the screen out of view, or the bullet hits the alien.
