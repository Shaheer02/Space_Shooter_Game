## How To Play

## *Gameplay and Scoring*
- If the bulelt hits the alien, the score increases by one.
- Each time the alien is hit, it disappears, and a new alien falls to the bottom of the screen faster.
- If the alien hits the bottom of the screen, the game is over.

### *Bullet System*
- The spaceship may only fire one bullet
- The spaceship can only fire a bullet once the bullet has either gone to the top of the screen out of view, or the bullet hits the alien.
